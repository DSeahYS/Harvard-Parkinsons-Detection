## Key Innovations üß†
To-Be First Singapore-optimized pre-symptomatic Parkinson's screening combining:
MediaPipe Face Mesh for precision eye movement tracking
Ethnicity-specific analysis (Chinese, Malay, Indian) for Singapore population
BioNeMo Evo-2 genomic simulation with ethnicity-adjusted risk profiles
DeepSeek V3 LLM integration for clinical assessment
Detects neurological markers 5-7 years before motor symptoms appear

## Features ‚ú®
Component	Capabilities
Dashboard     All in 1 UI. (Currently broken)
Eye Tracking	Real-time measurement of saccadic velocity (400-600¬∞/s norm), fixation stability, vertical saccades with ethnicity compensation
Genomic Simulation	Singapore-specific simulation of LRRK2, GBA, and SNCA variants with ethnicity adjustments for Chinese, Malay, and Indian populations
Medication Detection	Detects Levodopa efficacy through pupillary hippus analysis
Risk Assessment	Multi-modal scoring system with eye metrics (60%) and genomic factors (40%)
Clinical Assessment	DeepSeek V3 integration for comprehensive analysis and recommendations

## Tech Stack üîß
