## Analysis Request

Based on these ocular biomarkers and genomic findings, please provide:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the likelihood that this patient is in the pre-symptomatic or early stage of Parkinson's disease.

2. **Biomarker Interpretation**: Analyze each ocular metric and its specific relevance to PD pathophysiology, particularly focusing on basal ganglia involvement in eye movement control.

3. **Clinical Recommendations**: Suggest appropriate follow-up evaluations, additional tests (e.g., DaTscan, neuropsychological assessment), and monitoring intervals.

4. **Differential Considerations**: Identify other conditions that might present with similar ocular findings.

5. **Treatment & Management**: Outline potential preventive strategies, lifestyle modifications, or monitoring protocols appropriate for this patient's risk profile.

6. **Prognostic Timeline**: Estimate the potential timeframe for symptom development based on the pre-symptomatic markers identified.

7. **Concise Summary**: Provide a brief clinical summary suitable for inclusion in medical records.

Please ensure that your analysis is evidence-based, referencing the established relationship between ocular biomarkers and pre-motor PD pathology. Current research indicates these metrics can detect PD 5-7 years before motor symptoms emerge.

I need to explain eye tracking and genetic test results to {patient_data.get('name', 'a patient')} who is {patient_data.get('age', 'an adult')} years old. Their test results show a {risk_category} risk level ({risk_level*100:.1f}%) for early Parkinson's disease based on eye movement patterns.

1. Explains what the eye tracking test measures in simple terms
2. Describes how eye movements can reveal early brain changes before other symptoms appear
3. Puts the {risk_category} risk level in context without causing unnecessary alarm
4. Outlines practical next steps and what they might expect

Use plain language, avoid jargon, use helpful analogies, and maintain a hopeful but honest tone. Focus on empowering the patient with knowledge rather than causing anxiety.
